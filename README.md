# Godblogs
### Where Godder talks about God stuff.
**GodBlogs** is a website made by [\[GodderE2D\]](https://www.godder.ga/) (me) to talk about some God stuff. God stuff are epic, are you more Godder than me? Yes, I know, not very funny, is it?
Below you can see ways on how to contribute, self-host, and more this open-source project.

## Contributing
### Contributing to website exteriors
You can contribute to the project by opening a Github **pull request**. You can see existing pull requests in the **Pull requests** tab on this repository.

**IMPORANT:** You cannot contribute to the actual blog itself, basically the content on the blog. If you know how a blog functions, the author generally writes the blog content, right? That means that if you want to contribute, you cannot edit the content that I would make. You can edit existing blog posts if they are misleading.
**Do** contribute to my the website more pleasing to look at.
**Do** change any broken links in my blog posts.
**Do** add interesting new features.
**Do not** write a new blog post for me.

### Bug hunting
Found a bug? Please open an **issue** by going to the **Issues** tab on this repository. Please describe the bug in detail, and I will look my best into fixing it.
Bugs can mean so much things: typos, CSS `<div>` misalignment, and a lot more. If it's still minor, just report it! It's better for it to be known than hidden.
**Found the solution to the bug?** Please open a pull request instead! See above for details.

### Feedback/suggestions
I'd love to hear from you, and I think the community will too! Please open a topic in the **Discussions** tab on this repository. I can't wait to hear from you! :)
