# Godblogs

Hi! I'm **\[GodderE2D\]**. You might know me from other places. I'm probably Godder than you, which by the way, means better than you. This is where I store all of ~~my personal information which definetly wasn't public for 3 months before~~ my awesome God-like thoughts.  
**Need tutorials?** I got you covered.  
**Need my personal thoughts on terrible companies?** I got you covered.  
Anything that you don't want, I have. It's going to be a wild ride, hang on! ðŸ‘¿

## Open Source
Oh my gosh, a blog that is open source? Yes! Or maybe I'm just too lazy to tick the **Private repository** box in my repo settings.  
Anyways, you should read the [README.md](https://github.com/GodderE2D/godblogs#readme) if you want to know how to contribute. Thanks!

## A final note
Don't copy and paste, please, I got a really crappy DMCA takedown service and I'm too poor to find actual lawyers. Please. Thanks... ðŸ¥º
